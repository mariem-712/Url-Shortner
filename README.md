Project Name
  Monitoring a Containerized URL Shortener Webservice

Project Idea
  The project aims to build, containerize, and monitor a fully functional URL shortener web service.
  It allows users to shorten long URLs and redirect to the original ones while collecting performance and operational metrics using Prometheus and Grafana.
  The goal is to create a self-contained system that demonstrates real-world DevOps practices — including containerization, monitoring, alerting, and persistence.

Team Members (pentaRae)
  - Mostafa Taha Mohamed Abdelsamea (Team Leader)
  - Maryam Sayed Fathy Abdelhamid
  - Abdelrahman Hesham AbouElkasem El-Genidy
  - Haneen Akram Ahmed
  - Mohamed Essam Eldin Fahmy
  - George Ayman Moneer

Work Plan
1.Research & Analysis
   Study existing URL shortener services (like Bitly) to identify essential features.
   Analyze monitoring requirements (metrics, dashboards, alerts).
   Define personas:
    - End User: shortens and uses links.
    - DevOps Engineer: monitors performance and stability.
    - Developer: maintains and improves the service.
    
2.Visual Identity
oLogo design

3.Main Designs
oPoster

4.Complementary Products
  - README documentation
  - Grafana dashboard JSON configuration
  - Docker Compose setup for easy deployment
  - Example API requests using Postman


5.Review & Finalization
  Test all services (application, Prometheus, Grafana) running together.
  Verify that metrics and alerts work as expected.
  Conduct internal review and fix performance issues.

6.Final Presentation
  Demonstrate full workflow:
    - Shorten a URL → redirect successfully.
    - View metrics update in Prometheus and Grafana in real-time.
    - Trigger a 404 alert and show Grafana notification.
  Present system architecture, monitoring pipeline, and persistence setup.
